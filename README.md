In this repository I'll be adding general problems related to algorithms and data structure, dividing by folders between topics, presenting and explaining the solutions, as well as their concepts.

Gradually I'll advance to more complex themes and problems. In the future I'll be able to bring the solutions in different programming languages, in addition to translating the content to pt-br.

It can be usefull for academics or people who will participate in interviews.
